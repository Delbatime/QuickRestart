About the issue:

Only happens when you die in a den or die through deletion (Like falling out of a room)

Leviathans have...interesting effects when you die to them.


It appears the AI breaking effect happens when you either abstractize the creature (from putting them into a den) or delete them.
   Abstractizing the creature does delete them, test whenever they will always do this.
   
   
PoleMimic.Stickchunks will not change after the player dies, this is what causes the passiveness.

Apparently physical objects are separated by collision layer in this game.


Weird glitches : You can kill yourself with spears after dying to leviathan?
Dlls/DLL walls cannot grab you after eating you
When reviving too early to a leviathan you get softlocked [FIXED]
